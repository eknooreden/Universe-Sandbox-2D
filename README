This is a simple sandbox game in which you can simply just expiriment with gravity.

It was just simply made for some testing although can be used for fun. It was also inspired from the game
Universe Sandbox which is a 3D model of the universe in which you can play around in. This was a more simplistic 
2D version of that although it still messes around with gravity using the equation for a planets gravity.

------------Controls--------------

The controls are relativly simple:

- Left click to have a planet insta orbit it's greater mass
- Right click to have a planet spawn with natural proper gravity
- Drag hold and release right click to have a planet spawn with natural gravity and
    the further you hold the more speed the planet comes with and the direction is choosable,
    this is more over useful for trying to get some orbits

-----------Features--------------

The features are also simple but fun.

Everytime you spawn a new celestial mass ( just a mass that takes up space ), it spawns with a random color 
selected from a small list of colors although colorful either way.

Everytime you start the pygame window there will be a singular mass/star already in the center with 
a decently high gravity.

Everytime 2 masses collide, it forms a bigger mass of greater gravity.

The main star that spawns in the beginning can not leave the veiwers screen although the spawned planets can. The main star will just bounce on the edges.

Also please say anything about glitches to fix.

Thank you and have fun!
